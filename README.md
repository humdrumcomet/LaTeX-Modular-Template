## Overview and Usage
This repository provides a template with example code for you to investigate and learn about creating modular documents.
If you would like to use this with Overleaf, you can download it by clicking on the green "Code" button above and downloading the .zip file, and then uploading the zip to your Overleaf projects. 
You can compile each element independently by opening the relevent .tex file, or compile the overall document from the modularReportTemplate.tex file.
If you would like to get the empty template, you can go to the [main](https://github.com/humdrumcomet/LaTeX-Modular-Template/) branch of this repository by clicking the link.
