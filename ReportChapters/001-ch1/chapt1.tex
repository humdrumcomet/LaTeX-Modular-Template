    \section{Using Equations}
        Demonstrating the acronym capabilities, I first talk about \gls{uhv} and then the second time I talk about \gls{uhv} it is the short form!
        Another acronym could be \gls{cnc}, which shortens nicely to just \gls{cnc}.
        We can also talk about the speed of light \gls{c}, or the variables used in the Equations \ref{eqt:lorenz1}-\ref{eqt:lorenz3}, \gls{lr}, \gls{ls}, \gls{lb}.
        \ExecuteMetaData[\importPath/equations.tex]{lorenzAttr}
        For good measure we'll be sure to cite \cite{Bello_2017}, and \cite{Knuth_2022}.
    \section{Using Figures}
        A simple tikz rectangle
        \ExecuteMetaData[\importPath/assets.tex]{tikzrectangle}
        Or something more interesting like \ref{fig:tikzFET}? Notice the use of the symbols for \gls{mg}, \gls{ms}, \gls{md}.
